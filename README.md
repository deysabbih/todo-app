# todo-app
A simple to-do list web app built with **HTML, CSS and JavaScript**.

## About this Project
This project was created by following [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/G0jO8kUrg-I?si=xlElhx48sM6QAQDs).
I customized the colours and background to a Miffy theme to practice my CSS skills further.

The goal was to learn:
- DOM manipulation in JavaScript
- Using CSS for layout and styling
- Using HTML for structuring the page

### Features
- Add and delete tasks
- Save tasks in localStorage (data stays after refresh)
- Custom background and colors

### Future Improvements
- Add to-do categories for different task types (e.g. school, work, personal)
- Dark mode toggle
